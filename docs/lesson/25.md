# Lesson 25: Home page intro

<ContentWarning />
 
[CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) is a powerful layout tool that’s supported by the vast majority of browsers. Historically, it’s proven pretty difficult for folks to get their heads around, including me, so let’s try to change that.

In this lesson, I’m going to teach you how to build a pretty cool layout with CSS Grid that’s a bit of a brain teaser. Hopefully by the end of this lesson, you’ll feel a bit more comfortable with CSS Grid than when you started.

## What we’re building

On our home page we have a block called `intro` that morphs into different layouts depending on the viewport it finds itself in. Let’s take a quick look at it in a responsive design tool I like to use called [Sizzy](https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/49831/105166?link=1947), which lets us create multiple different responsive contexts on one screen:

![The home page intro morphs between a stacked layout and a complex grid layout based on the viewport. There are multiple devices such as iPhones, Macs and Android phones](/images/courses/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/ss-intro-sizzy.jpg)

There’s a lot going on, right? Let’s build it!

## Wiring up our block and critical CSS

This intro **only** appears on the home page, so we’re going to first create a `home.scss` file.

In your `scss` folder, create a new file called `home.scss` and add the following to it:

```scss
// First up: config and functions
@import 'config';

// Set Gorko to output no CSS for this file
$outputTokenCSS: false;

// Next: pull in gorko for design tokens
@import '../../node_modules/gorko/gorko.scss';

// Pull in blocks
@import 'blocks/intro';
```

This is almost identical to our `critical.scss` file, but the difference here is that we’re instructing [Gorko](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/gorko) not to generate utility classes by setting `$outputTokenCSS` to `false`.

We need to add the block now, so create a new file in your `blocks` folder called `_intro.scss` and add the following to it:

```scss
.intro {
  // Default is a single column layout where the header overlaps the media
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: get-size('700') minmax(0, 1fr) get-size('700') auto;
  grid-gap: get-size('500');

  // Force items to span 1 column
  > * {
    grid-column: 1;
  }
}
```

This is our default CSS. Even though we’re in a one column layout, we still use Grid. This is mainly because we want our headline to overlay the image. This is what we’re after:

![The intro headline overlaying the background image](/images/courses/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/ss-intro-grid-default.jpg)

The first thing we do is set our rows up. The first row uses a size token (`get-size('700')`) because we want a bit of our image to display on its own first. Then we use `minmax(0, 1fr)` which allows the **next row** to grow to **1 part of the available remaining space**. But importantly, it can be `0` if there’s nothing in it.

Following this is another explicitly sized row that uses a size token again, to allow some image to show through. This is followed by an `auto` row for the content and button.

We then use a direct child selector: `> *` to select **only the direct children** and force them to span the entire width with `grid-column: 1`.

Right, let’s get funky now.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/scss/blocks/_intro.scss` and just before the end of the block closing bracket, at around **line 11**, add the following:

```scss
&__header {
  padding: get-size('300') get-size('500');
  background: rgba(get-color('tertiary'), 0.95);
  z-index: 1;
  grid-row: 2;
  margin: 0 get-size('500'); // Adds a horizontal gutter

  // Prevents it from stretching to fill the space
  align-self: center;
}

&__heading {
  em {
    font-style: normal;
    display: block;

    // The weight change creates a weird indent, so this
    // optical adjustment fixes it
    transform: translateX(-3px);
  }
}

&__media {
  grid-row: 1/4;
  position: relative;

  img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
  }
}

&__content {
  grid-row: 4;

  p {
    max-width: 30ch;
  }
}
```

Brush aside some of the core visual CSS for a moment, because that stuff is pretty self-explanatory. Instead, focus on the `grid-row` for each of these elements, where defined. As explained before, we’re specifically telling our elements which row to place themselves on.

For example, we wanted the `&__header` to appear over the image. The first step to doing that is telling the header to sit in row 2, with `grid-row: 2`. Then, we tell our image to span from row 1 to **the start** of row 4 with `grid-row: 1/4`.

::: tip

Understanding how grid rows, columns and grid lines work is _really_ hard. I **strongly** recommend that you check out this fantastic resource, by Rachel Andrew, called [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com/).

I _constantly_ refer to it myself.

Right, let’s expand this layout for larger screens.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/scss/blocks/_intro.scss` and straight after the last bit of code we added, on around **line 52**, add the following:

```scss
// Switch to an inline layout with some vert space
// above the header and content
@include media-query('md') {
  grid-template-rows: get-size('500') auto auto auto;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(15rem, 1fr) 2fr;

  &__header {
    padding: get-size('500');
    margin: 0;
    grid-column: 1/3;
    justify-self: start;
    align-self: end;
  }

  &__media {
    grid-column: 3/2;
    grid-row: 1/5;
  }

  &__content {
    grid-row: 3/4;
    grid-column: 1;
  }
}
```

Here we’re expanding the layout for our `md` breakpoint, which is essentially tablet and up. Notice the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` part? What we’re doing here is making our grid 4 rows high, with the first row being explicitly sized. This gives us a nice little vertical offset. Then, we’re making this a two column layout.

We want the content to be narrower than the image so we’re splitting it `1fr` and `2fr`. Remember, an `fr` is **exactly one part of the available remaining space**. We’re doing a magic trick here, too, by using `minmax` to say “make sure the element is at least `15rem` wide. If it is, fill the space up to `1fr` only”. This allows us some control to make sure that the content will still be legible if things get a bit tight.

Let’s take a look at this diagram where I’ve drawn the grid lines:

![The larger, expanded layout has lines that create the 4 row and two column layout](/images/courses/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/ss-intro-grid.jpg)

The fourth row is chopped off the end of this viewport, but hopefully those lines help you to visualise how the grid now looks.

In the code above, we’re setting both rows and columns for our elements to place them where we want to place them. As always, the `&__header` gives us the most interesting CSS. We tell it to fill the entire grid with `grid-column: 1/3`. You might be thinking “that’s weird because the grid is only two columns wide”, right? By using `3`, we are saying, “end on grid line 3” which sits at the end of our defined grid.

We use `justify-self: start` to break the default justification of `stretch`. This means our header will only display as wide as the content within it. This works very much the same as flexbox does.

Finally, we achieve the overlap again because our header and image share the same column and row space. We make the image fill all the rows by setting `grid-row: 1/5`. This works the same as the header and its columns.

Ok, _nearly there_. Let’s wrap up by adding some code for larger breakpoints. Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/scss/blocks/_intro.scss` and add the following after the last bit of code, on around **line 78**:

```scss
// Flip the ratio for larger breakpoints
@include media-query('lg') {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(44rem, 1fr);

  // Because it's so large, it make sense to limit the image height too
  &__media {
    height: 28rem;
  }
}
```

Because we have more room now, we change the column layout to be more 50/50 instead. We use `minmax` to make sure our image is at least `44rem` wide. Then, finally, we give our image a fixed height.

When all of that is in, your `_intro.scss` file should look like this:

```diff
.intro {
  // Default is a single column layout where the header overlaps the media
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: get-size('700') minmax(0, 1fr) get-size('700') auto;
  grid-gap: get-size('500');

  // Force items to span 1 column
  > * {
    grid-column: 1;
  }

  &__header {
    padding: get-size('300') get-size('500');
    background: rgba(get-color('tertiary'), 0.95);
    z-index: 1;
    grid-row: 2;
    margin: 0 get-size('500'); // Adds a horizontal gutter

    // Prevents it from stretching to fill the space
    align-self: center;
  }

  &__heading {
    em {
      font-style: normal;
      display: block;

      // The weight change creates a weird indent, so this
      // optical adjustment fixes it
      transform: translateX(-3px);
    }
  }

  &__media {
    grid-row: 1/4;
    position: relative;

    img {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      object-fit: cover;
    }
  }

  &__content {
    grid-row: 4;

    p {
      max-width: 30ch;
    }
  }

  // Switch to an inline layout with some vert space
  // above the header and content
  @include media-query('md') {
    grid-template-rows: get-size('500') auto auto auto;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(15rem, 1fr) 2fr;

    &__header {
      padding: get-size('500');
      margin: 0;
      grid-column: 1/3;
      justify-self: start;
      align-self: end;
    }

    &__media {
      grid-column: 3/2;
      grid-row: 1/5;
    }

    &__content {
      grid-row: 3/4;
      grid-column: 1;
    }
  }

  // Flip the ratio for larger breakpoints
  @include media-query('lg') {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(44rem, 1fr);

    // Because it's so large, it make sense to limit the image height too
    &__media {
      height: 28rem;
    }
  }
}
```

Now the last thing we need to do is define a page critical style for our home page. We covered this in the last module when we set our Sass up. The Sass part is now done, we just need to make `base.html` aware that there’s a critical CSS file to add to the pile.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts/home.html` and on **line 2** add the following:

```html
{% set pageCriticalStyles = ['css/home.css'] %}
```

Your intro layout should look like this, when you open <http://localhost:8080>:

## Wrapping up

That was a heck of a lesson, right? I really want you to walk away from this course not just with kickass Eleventy knowledge, but also kickass front-end, specifically CSS, knowledge.

We’re going to fill out the rest of the home page CSS in the next lesson which—you guessed it—will have lots more grid!
