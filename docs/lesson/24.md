# Lesson 24: Styling the skip link

<ContentWarning />
 
A skip link allows a user to skip past the header and navigation and jump straight to the `<main>` element. At the moment, ours is very visible, but we’re going to visually hide it _until_ it is focused.

When it’s focused, it’ll look the same as the buttons on the site, so the first thing we’ll do in this lesson is style those.

## Styling our site’s buttons

Create a new file in your `blocks` folder called `_button.scss` and add the following to it:

```scss
.button {
  @extend .radius;

  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.5rem 2rem;
  background: get-color('quaternary-glare');
  color: get-color('dark-shade');
  border: 2px solid;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-align: center;

  @include apply-utility('font', 'sans');
  @include apply-utility('weight', 'bold');

  // Make sure hover state trumps all variants with a good ol’ important
  &:hover {
    background: get-color('quaternary') !important;
    color: get-color('dark-shade') !important;
  }

  // Add a ghost modifier
  &[data-variant='ghost'] {
    background: transparent;
    color: get-color('quaternary-glare');
  }
}
```

Hopefully the references to `get-color`, and `apply-utility` are pretty recognisable to you now. They’re allowing us to apply design tokens that are set in `_config.scss`. As you can also see, a lot of this block is actually made up of tokens.

This is just another way of applying tokens to an element and, luckily, [Gorko](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/gorko) supports both ways seamlessly for us. Applying the different utilities on a button—especially with interactive states—would be suboptimal.

A couple of things to mention is that we’re using a Sass `@extends` here. These are absolutely fine, but use them with care. If you’re not careful, your Sass can generate **a lot** of extra selectors which can really bloat your CSS.

Lastly, we’re using `!important` on the hover state, too. The reason for this is that we’re dealing with two button variants: the normal `.button` and the exception, `.button[data-variant="ghost"]`. Because the exception has a higher specificity than the `.button` _and_ the hover state, it actually makes a lot of sense to give the hover state a boost with an `!important`. Again, use these with care.

## Styling the skip link

Now we have our button styles, we can style the skip link. This block is _tiny_, but hella powerful. Let’s add it.

Create another file in your `blocks` folder called `_skip-link.scss` and add the following to it:

```scss
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: get-size('400');
  left: get-size('400');
  z-index: 99;

  // @extends should be used with care, but this is a great example of them being hella useful
  &:not(:focus) {
    @extend .visually-hidden;
  }
}
```

We’ve already applied the `.button` class to our skip link in `base.html`, but what we also needed to add was that **specific block style**.

That starts with making the button `absolute`. Setting `position: absolute` pulls an element out of the document flow, meaning that wherever it finds itself, it will no longer affect any of its surrounding elements. We’ve done this to make sure it sits in the top left.

Then, the real magic happens. This is the sort of thing that I _love_ about Sass. We make the skip link extend the existing `.visually-hidden` utility **only** when it isn’t focused. This means that when it’s not focused, only screen reader users can “see” it, but when it’s focused, everyone can see it!

::: tip

The visually hidden utility is really useful because using `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` actually hides elements from screen reader users. The CSS that we write in the visually hidden utility fixes this by using `clip` and `position: absolute` to achieve the same _visual_ result, while maintaining a valid accessible result.

You can see this utility in `eleventy-from-scratch/src/scss/utilities/_visually-hidden.scss`.

## Wiring it all up

Just like in the last lesson, we need to import this CSS, so open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/scss/critical.scss` and add the following, with the other block `@import` statements:

```scss
@import 'blocks/button';
@import 'blocks/skip-link';
```

Now when you open up <http://localhost:8080> and press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key, it should look like this:

## Wrapping up

The skip link is an accessibility power tool and you could certainly take this knowledge and apply it to other projects.

Let’s move on and have some fun with CSS Grid!
