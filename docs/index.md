In this [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) course, we go from a completely empty directory to a full-blown marketing site for a design agency, and along the way, **we dive really deep into Eleventy** _and_ **front-end development best practices**.

Over the course of **31 written lessons**, split over **4 modules**, you will learn **core Eleventy platform knowledge**—_step-by-step_—to build out a real-world project. The linear project structure **helps your learning** because you’re **working with a real context**, rather than foo bar or fizzbuzz. This also means you’ll actually achieve something at the end that you can build on, too!

It’s not just a course about Eleventy, either. We’re learning how to **build a fast, lightweight website** that’s progressively enhanced with the **user** at the forefront. You’re going to **learn some solid HTML, CSS and accessibility best practices** just by completing this course.

Finally—if that wasn’t enough to convince your already—you’ll learn about **design implementation, details and refinement** to achieve a **solid, professional end-product**.

**You don’t need to be an experienced developer to take this course**. All you need is **basic HTML and CSS skills**, with some **optional JavaScript skills**.

Everything is explained, in detail, in a friendly, conversational manner, and if you get stuck in any of the lessons, you can **download the project files**, so you’ll have no blockers and you’ll maintain your momentum. Because it’s a written course, it’s available offline by default too.

Now is the time to get into the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), with static site generators. By taking this course, you’re going to get a solid head-start in that.

## About your instructor

Your instructor for Learn Eleventy From Scratch is me, [Andy Bell](//twitter.com/piccalilli_)—a freelance designer and front-end developer—based in the UK. I have worked in the design and web industries for well over a decade and in that time, I have worked with some of the largest organisations in the world, like Google, Harley-Davidson, BSkyB, Unilever, Oracle, Capita, Vice Media and the NHS.

Over these years, I have worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given me a lot of experience over a large variety of project types. It also means I’ve worked with a lot of teams in various sizes—each with their own constraints and goals. These projects vary between design systems, creative campaign work and good ol’ websites.

I mostly specialise in CSS—whether that is writing a [course for Google](https://web.dev/learn/css/), co-authoring a [book on CSS layout](https://every-layout.dev), or creating a [methodology to help people write better CSS](https://cube.fyi). Most of my client work involves me applying this experience to help teams write better CSS—often by helping them create a design system.

You can read more about me over on my [personal blog](https://andy-bell.co.uk/), or catch up with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/piccalilli) or [Github](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli).
