# Lesson 12: Blog post view, directory data and filters

<ContentWarning />
 
We’ve got all of our front-end feeds set up for the blog now, which is most of the battle. Now, let’s focus on rendering a blog post itself.

## Creating our blog post layout

We need a layout to render a blog post for us. We’ve already covered how layouts work, so instead of going over that again, let’s get straight into it.

Create a new file in your `layouts` folder called `post.html` and add the following to it:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}

{% set pageHeaderTitle = title %}

{# Render post date and any tags that this post has been filed under #}
{% set pageHeaderSummary %}
  <time datetime="{{ date | w3DateFilter }}">{{ date | dateFilter }}</time>
  {% if tags %}
    <p class="visually-hidden" id="tags-desc">Tags that this post has been filed under.</p>
    <ul class="tags-list" aria-describedby="tags-desc">
      {% for tag in tags %}
        <li>
          <a href="/tag/{{ tag | slug }}/">#{{ tag | title | replace(' ', '') }}</a>
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endif %}
{% endset %}

{% block content %}
  <article>
    {% include "partials/page-header.html" %}
    
    <div class="[ page-content ] [ flow wrapper ] [ flow-space-700 gap-top-700 ]">
      {{ content | safe }}
    </div>
  </article>

  {% include "partials/cta.html" %}
{% endblock %}
```

The stuff inside our `{% block content %}` block is pretty standard at this point, so let’s focus on the content we’re creating for our **page header**.

We have to set a `pageHeaderTitle` and, for this, we’re using our `title`. This takes the current post title, set in the page’s Front Matter.

For this instance of the page header, we’ve also defined `pageHeaderSummary`, and we’re using a cool feature of Nunjucks to do it. In Nunjucks, we usually set a variable like this: `{% set myVariable = 'value' %}`—and that’s exactly how we’ve set the `pageHeaderTitle` in this template.

You can also set a variable like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
{% set myVariable %} 
  I can put whatever <b>I like</b> in here. 
{% endset %}
```

What this does is capture everything between `{% set %}` and `{% endset %}` and assign that to `myVariable`.

In the context of `pageHeaderSummary`, we’ve rendered some markup in our `{% set %}` block. This is because with a blog post, we want a bit of extra data in the page header, like posted date and tags.

The tags themselves are pretty straightforward: we take the `tags` from our Front Matter (remember, they’re an array) and we loop each one. Inside each iteration of the loop, we generate a list item with a link to that tag. Using the [replace filter from Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#replace), we create a Twitter-style hashtag as the label of the link. Using the [Eleventy slug filter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/slug/), we create a URL friendly version of the tag. This means that `Design Thinking` becomes `design-thinking`.

::: tip

There’s two accessibility things I want to bring to your attention here. With the hashtags, we’re using a capital case Nunjucks filter: [title](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#title). Where there are no spaces, like this, having a capital letter for each word means that some screen readers will announce each word separately.

We also create an `aria-describedby` relationship with a `<p>` and the `<ul>` that houses the tags. This is to provide context to a screen reader user where the visual context might not be available. You can [read more about this ARIA role here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute).

## Filters

We’re already using some in-built filters on this page, but it’s finally time to create our own. If you look in your terminal or visit <http://localhost:8080> now, you’ll see that your build of the site is currently broken. Let’s fix it!

In your terminal, stop Eleventy by pressing `ctrl` and `c`, then in the terminal, enter the following:

```bash
mkdir src/filters
```

In your newly-added `filters` folder, create a file called `date-filter.js` and add the following to it:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

module.exports = value => {
  const dateObject = moment(value);
  return `${dateObject.format('Do')} of ${dateObject.format('MMMM YYYY')}`;
};
```

We’re using a package here called [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment), which is a very useful package for working with JavaScript dates. Formatting dates with JavaScript is usually absolutely fine (as we’ll learn shortly). But because this JavaScript is only run at **build time** we can afford ourselves a developer experience treat, without making our users pay for it. This is because we’re adding a suffix to our date. Moment makes that a trivial exercise, compared with JavaScript.

The code runs the Moment `format` method on our passed date. This is all merged together and returned as a nice formatted string that looks like this: `1st of April 2020`.

Because we’ve added a package, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm install moment
```

Now let’s add the other filter. Create another file in your `filters` folder called `w3-date-filter.js` and add the following to it:

```javascript
module.exports = value => {
  const dateObject = new Date(value);

  return dateObject.toISOString();
};
```

This one is straightforward. Because the HTML [`<time>` element](https://css-tricks.com/time-element/) accepts an ISO formatted date for the `datetime` attribute, all we need to do is use the native JavaScript `Date`—specifically the handy [`toISOString` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString).

The last thing we need to do with these filters is tell Eleventy about them. Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/.eleventy.js` and at the top of the file, add the following:

```javascript
// Filters
const dateFilter = require('./src/filters/date-filter.js');
const w3DateFilter = require('./src/filters/w3-date-filter.js');
```

That’s us importing the filters we just wrote. Now let’s link them up to Eleventy. While still in `.eleventy.js`, just after the `module.exports = config => {` bit, on around **line 8**, add the following:

```javascript
// Add filters
config.addFilter('dateFilter', dateFilter);
config.addFilter('w3DateFilter', w3DateFilter);
```

Now Eleventy knows about the filters, we can head back to our terminal and run `npm start`, which _should_ result in no errors. Happy days!

::: tip

In Eleventy, you can also add filters for specific templating languages. For example, we could add our filters **just** for Nunjucks like this:

```javascript
// Add filters
config.addNunjucksFilter('dateFilter', dateFilter);
config.addNunjucksFilter('w3DateFilter', w3DateFilter);
```

That’s not especially useful in our project, but if you have a couple of different templating languages running that need to be segregated, this can be a very handy feature indeed.

## Default layout and permalinks

We’ve got ourselves a fully functioning layout now, but we’re not linking it to our blog posts in Front Matter. You might think this is rather odd, but there’s a specific reason for it.

Eleventy lets us assign data to **all content** in a folder. Our blog posts all live in `posts`, so inside there, we can set data in a `posts.json` file.

Create a new file in your `posts` folder called `posts.json` and add the following to it:

```json
{
  "layout": "layouts/post.html",
  "permalink": "/blog/{{ title | slug }}/index.html"
}
```

This is called a directory data file. Inside it, we’re telling all items added to `posts` that they should use the `post.html` layout **unless they specify a different layout in their Front Matter**.

The second thing we’re doing is setting a permalink. Eleventy, by default, will use the filename and its directory to create a permalink. This means that, without our current setting, a post with a file name of `my-lovely-post.md` would have a permalink of `/posts/my-lovely-post/index.html`. We want all of our posts to live in the blog section though, so what we’re doing in the value for `permalink` is setting `/blog` as the root and then creating a slug from the post’s title.

Now, if you open your browser at <http://localhost:8080/blog/laws-of-ux/> it should look like this:

## Wrapping up

We’ve learned some real fundamentals here—especially building our own custom filters. This functionality is what really engaged me with Eleventy in the first place, after years of working with Jekyll, where such capability was problematic, to say the least.

In the next lesson, we’re going to improve our layout further by adding a “more posts” feed.
