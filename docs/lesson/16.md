# Lesson 16: Creating a work item page

The first part of this lesson is another chance to apply what weâ€™ve learned previously by creating our work item page.

Weâ€™ll then go one step further and learn how you can create relationships with content by linking team members to the items they worked on.

## Adding our template

Create a new file in your `layouts` folder called `work-item.html` and add the following to it:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}  

{% block content %}
<section class="work-item">
  <header class="hero">
    <div class="[ hero__inner ] [ wrapper ]">
      <div class="[ hero__content ] [ dot-shadow radius flow ] [ bg-dark-shade color-light flow-space-400 ]">
        <h1 class="[ headline ] [ measure-compact ]" data-highlight="quinary">
          {{ title }}
        </h1>
        <p class="measure-short">{{ summary }}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <img src="{{ hero.image }}" alt="{{ hero.imageAlt }}" class="hero__image" />
  </header>
  <article class="[ key-facts ] [ panel dot-shadow ] [ bg-primary-shade color-light ]">
    <div class="wrapper flow">
      <h2 class="headline" data-highlight="secondary">Key facts</h2>
      <div class="leading-flat font-sans weight-bold flow-space-700">
        <ol class="[ key-facts__list ] [ auto-grid ]">
          {% for item in keyFacts %}
            <li class="flow flow-space-300">
              <span class="text-700 lg:text-800 color-secondary-glare"
                >{{ item.primary }}</span
              >
              <span class="text-600 lg:text-700">{{ item.secondary }}</span>
            </li>
          {% endfor %}
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
  </article>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <article class="[ gallery ] [ flow flow-space-800 ]">
      {% for item in gallery %}
        <figure class="[ gallery__item ] [ flow ]">
          <div class="[ gallery__media ] [ frame ]" data-frame="primary">
            <img src="{{ item.image }}" alt="" aria-hidden="true" class="radius" />
          </div>
          <figcaption class="[ gallery__content ] [ flow ]">
            <h2 class="[ gallery__heading ] [ text-700 md:text-900 ]">
              {{ item.title }}
            </h2>
            <p class="[ gallery__summary ] [ measure-short flow-space-300 ]">
              {{ item.summary }}
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      {% endfor %}
    </article>
  </div>
</section>

{% include "partials/cta.html" %} 

{% endblock %}
```

This should be all pretty straightforward for you by now, because weâ€™ve already covered a lot it in this course. Weâ€™re grabbing Front Matter and applying it on the page. The `gallery` and `keyFacts` are both arrays of objects that we loop through and generate collections of content.

The `gallery` uses `<figure>` elements for the same reason as we covered earlier in the course: they are contained pieces of content with media and [flow content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Flow_content).

So far, so straightforward, right? Letâ€™s turn up the heat a bit.

## Adding related content

Letâ€™s spend a second thinking about our siteâ€™s context. Itâ€™s a website for a design agency and this template weâ€™re working on is used for a portfolio item. These items will have had team members working on them. If you open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/work/outgoings.md` and scroll to the end of the Front Matter, you should see this:

```diff
team: [1, 4, 6]
---
```

These reference items from the `people` collection which each have a `key` in their Front Matter. This `key` is used like an ID field and is what the `team` section of the **work item Front Matter** is referencing.

To break it down, weâ€™re saying that team members 1, 4 and 6 worked on this project together. We need to find those team members in the `people` collection and put them on the page. The first thing weâ€™ll do is grab them by creating a handy **helper function**.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_data/helpers.js`. At the bottom of the file, inside of the last `};`, add the following:

```javascript
/**
 * Take an array of keys and return back items that match.
 * Note: items in the collection must have a key attribute in
 * Front Matter
 *
 * @param {Array} collection 11ty collection
 * @param {Array} keys collection of keys
 * @returns {Array} result collection or empty
 */
filterCollectionByKeys(collection, keys) {
  return collection.filter(x => keys.includes(x.data.key));
}
```

::: tip

Remember to add a comma at the end of the function that comes before this new one. The closing bracket of the previous function looked like this: `}`. It should now look like this: `},`.

**Without this, the JavaScript will break.**

:::

The documentation on that function explains what it does for us. It takes a passed collection and some keys (array of numbers) and then, using `filter()`, returns back items that belong in `keys`.

Letâ€™s apply this helper to our template. Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts/work-item.html`. Just before the `{% block content %}` part, add the following:

```html
{% set peopleItems = helpers.filterCollectionByKeys(collections.people, team) %}
```

What we do here is grab the `people` collection and then pass in the `team` array thatâ€™s set in our Front Matter. This will then return **3 people** that match that criteria, which is now available in `peopleItems`.

Now we have that data, letâ€™s render it. At the bottom of `work-item.html`, just before the closing `</section>`: add the following:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
{% if peopleItems %}
  <article class="[ no-js-hidden ] [ panel dot-shadow ] [ bg-light-glare ]">
    <div class="[ wrapper ] [ flow flow-space-700 ]">
      <h2 class="[ headline ] [ measure-micro color-quinary ]" data-highlight="dark">
        Meet the team behind this project
      </h2>
      {% include "partials/people.html" %}
    </div>
  </article>
{% endif %}
```

Remember how `peopleItems` provides the `partials/people.html` with data for us? Well now that weâ€™ve loaded `peopleItems`, via our helper, we can render them with this existing code. The rest of the HTML is providing us with some semantics and structure.

## Assigning our layout to our work items

Now we have all the code written we need to instruct all `work` items to use our new layoutâ€”just like with the `posts` in previous lessons.

Create a new file in your `work` folder called `work.json` and add the following.

```json
{
  "layout": "layouts/work-item.html"
}
```

If you open up your browser at <http://localhost:8080/work/outgoings/> it should now look like this:

## Wrapping up

Relationships between content arenâ€™t often mentioned in coverage about SSGs like Eleventy, and I wanted to change that in this course. Creating this sort of relationship is really useful for when youâ€™re building large sites.

The beauty of using a consistent `key` item in Front Matter (it could also be `id` if you wanted) is that we can also create flexible helpers to grab content for us, too.

Right, letâ€™s move onto the last lesson of this module ðŸŽ‰
